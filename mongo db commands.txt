Local - Database
startup-log - Collection
The data inside are our documents

Creating databases (and editing them) through the command line

CREATE:
use db_name eg. use new_database

-this creates a new database and starts using it
-Databases (custom databases) are not visible until they contain a collection (which has to contain documents)

READ:
show dbs

-to see all existing databases

DELETE:
db.dropDatabase();

-delete an existing database
-when using a databse (with use db_name) you can pass in db instead of the name when doing commands

(copyDatabase is deprecated, use MongoDB docs to see the equivalent)UPDATE:
old_db.copyDatabase('old_db', 'new_db');
use old_db
db-dropDatabase();

-copy an existing database
-use the new database (you just copied)
-delete the old database

Exercise-
create 2 databases
show all databases
delete one of the databases
